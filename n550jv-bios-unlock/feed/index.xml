					<description><![CDATA[Hey,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#039;s almost an year since I&#039;ve done this mod but as far as I remember the other options are just duplicated entries of the ones under avanced and boot&lt;br /&gt;2) That&#039;s because modules have a checksum which needs to be fixed once you edit it. You can find how on the internet (there are open source softwares doing this). Sadly I can&#039;t recall the exact algorithm. You could also use phoenixtool (the one used for slic mods) instead of mmtool as it fixes the checksum by itself&lt;br /&gt;3) Yes, pretty sure. it&#039;s /gun tho, without space&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know how it goes ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this guide, I have some unsolved question:&lt;br /&gt;1) Why it&#039;s not necessary to change &#034;Access/Use&#034; in the other tabs? It seems there are hidden options even there.&lt;br /&gt;2) I can&#039;t complete the chipset tab mod because as I try to replace the &#034;Setup&#034; module MMTool complains with an &#034;invalid ffs file&#034;, any ideas?&lt;br /&gt;3) It doesn&#039;t seem that &#034;/ gun&#034; is a valid sequence of commands for afuwinx64.exe, are you sure about that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[N550JV.bin and N550JV.208 didn&#039;t work. I&#039;ve tried multiple times, different ports, with different flash drives (1G, 2G, 8G, FAT16, FAT32). It looks like N550JV.bin is indeed the right filename, there are several reports confirming this, but for some reason it doesn&#039;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is always the same: after pressing ctrl+home+power the led on flash drive starts blinking, this lasts for 5-8 seconds (I wonder what is it looking for), then the notebook reboots, keyboard blinks and there is no more activity on flash drive.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, it was a stock BIOS v208 from Asus. Pretty unfair to fail after changing an option which is available by default :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks like my only hope is getting the AMI recovery to work. CTRL+HOME combination does work, but it seems like either the filename is wrong (I&#039;ve tried AMIBOOT.ROM, N550JVAS.208, N550JVAS.bin and N550JVAS.rom) or it refuses to flash the same version or the checksum fails. If only there was some way of debugging like internal speaker...]]></description>
